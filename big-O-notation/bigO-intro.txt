What is Big O?

Formalized fuzzy counting.

Allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm
grows as the inputs grow.

Does not care about the details, only the trends.

O(1) Linear if f(n) = n
O(n^2) Quadratic if f(n) = n^2 
O(n) Constant if f(n) = 1 

Could be something entirely different! 

Big O = worst case scenario, upper bound for runtime.
