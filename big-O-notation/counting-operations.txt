One alternative to time is counting operations.

Using our example from before:
function addUpTo2(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

There are 3 operations in this example.
One multiplication, one addition, and one division.
It does not matter what the size of n is. 

In the less optimal solution, there were more operations.

function addUpTo(n) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i=1; i <= n; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total
}

There are as many plus operations as the size of n.
If n is 100, there are 100 plus operations.
If n is a million, there are a million plus operations. 

The number of operations grows proportionally with the size of n.
