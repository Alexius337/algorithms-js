Arrays are ORDERED lists.
Can be useful when you need order.
Very fast to access.
Can be costly.

Why are arrays slow?

Big O of Arrays:

Insertion: it depends
Removal: it depends

Searching: O(n)
Access: O(1)

Adding to the end (pushing): O(1) constant time

Adding/removing beginning of array: O(n)
Need to re-index every single element of the array!

Push/Pop always faster than Shift/Unshift 


Built in Array methods in JavaScript:

Push O(1)
Pop O(1)
Shift O(n)
Unshift O(n)
Concat O(n)
Slice O(n)
Splice O(n)
Sort O(n*logn)
forEach/map/filter/reduce O(n)
