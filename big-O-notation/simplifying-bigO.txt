Rules for simplifying Big O:

1) Constants don't matter.
O(2n) = O(n)
O(500) = O(1)
O(10n^2) = O(n^2)

2) Smaller terms don't matter.
O(n + 10) = O(n)
O(1000N + 50) = O(n)
O(n^2 + 5n + 8) = O(n^2)


Big O Shorthands:

1. Arithmetic operations are constant.
2. Variable assignment is constant.
3. Accessing elements in an array using an index (or object by key) is constant.
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop 
times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop.
