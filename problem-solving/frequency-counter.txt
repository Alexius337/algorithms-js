Frequency Counters patterns

Use an object in JavaScript to collect values and their frequencies 
Can avoid the need for nested loops and O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

Usually O(n) time compared to the easier solution which is O(n^2)

Example:
Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array.
The frequency of the values must be the same.
